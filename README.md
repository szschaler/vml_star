# VML*

VML* is a language for generating product models in model-driven software product lines. More precisely, VML* is itself a product line of such languages, as the first step is generating a VML* language specific to your modelling language of choice. More information can be found in our respective papers:

These sources are the original sources. In particular, they have not been updated to work with the newest version of XText etc. They will likely need a lot of work to make them work with the newest versions of existing frameworks, but, unfortunately, I don't foresee having the time required in the near future.
